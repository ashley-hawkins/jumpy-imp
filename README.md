# JumpyImp

Unimplemented features: Arrays
Known parser issues: Empty lines cause a parsing error

I'm gonna reimplement the parser and implement arrays in the new version I think.

Also if you actually read the code then I apologise because this was my first actual program written in Haskell and I have no idea how to write concise and pleasant Haskell code.

Example of how to use it:

`cabal run JumpyImp -- even.ji n:10` (Should return true)
`cabal run JumpyImp -- even.ji n:11` (Should return false)
